# Introduction

Welcome to the **Global GraceNote Editorial Standard** Website!
This example documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate) as a potential alternative to a Wiki page.

* **Pros**: Every chapter could be centralized in one single Markdown file / Versioning through GIT / Bigger control of the standard
* **Cons**: not as flexible to make modifications / and or comments when a specific piece of the Standard needs to change.
